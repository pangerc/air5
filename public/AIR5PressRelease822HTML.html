                <p>Air5 (air5.io), a new Silicon Valley-based technology company
                  focused on aligning wired and wireless networks, named
                  wireless veteran Jeff Brown its CEO and introduced its
                  disruptive patent-pending 5G-standards-based network
                  architecture that will, for the first time, effectively
                  harmonize disparate broadband infrastructures. The innovative
                  new concept allows a 5G-based network architecture to
                  seamlessly share cable’s hybrid fiber coaxial (HFC)
                  infrastructure with the industry’s current DOCSIS standard.
                  The patent-pending 5G-standards-based solution will empower
                  the next wave of innovation for cable operators, aid in
                  customer growth and retention, and forge alignment with
                  technology that is driving the mobile ecosystem for wireless
                  operators. (Photo: Business Wire)</p>

                <p>By aligning wireless and wired broadband networks into one
                  cohesive 5G infrastructure, Air5’s novel architecture will
                  facilitate more innovative and interconnected mobile solutions
                  and increase capabilities to achieve customer growth across
                  wired and wireless ecosystems. The company also expects its
                  new technology to bring faster speeds, higher levels of
                  security, and allow current broadband systems an elegant
                  migration path to Air5’s architecture, while also making it
                  easier to take advantage of advances in Artificial
                  Intelligence already implemented in 5G technology. (Graphic:
